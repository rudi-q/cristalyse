description: "Connect Cristalyse documentation to your AI coding assistant using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
---

The Cristalyse MCP Server provides AI coding assistants with direct access to Cristalyse documentation, examples, and best practices through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This enables your AI assistant to provide accurate, up-to-date information about Cristalyse directly in your coding environment.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. By adding the Cristalyse MCP server, your AI assistant gains access to:

- Complete Cristalyse documentation
- Code examples and snippets  
- Best practices and patterns
- API reference materials
- Troubleshooting guides
