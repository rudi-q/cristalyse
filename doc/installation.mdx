## Quick Installation

Adding Cristalyse to your Flutter project is incredibly simple. Just run one command:

```bash
flutter pub add cristalyse
```

That's it! No complex setup, no additional configuration needed.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to add the dependency manually, update your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cristalyse: ^1.6.1  # Latest version
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Verify Installation

Create a simple test to verify everything is working:

```dart lib/test_chart.dart
import 'package:cristalyse/cristalyse.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class TestChart extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CristalyseChart()
      .data([
        {'x': 1, 'y': 2},
        {'x': 2, 'y': 3},
        {'x': 3, 'y': 1},
      ])
      .mapping(x: 'x', y: 'y')
      .geomPoint()
      .build();
  }
}
```

If this compiles without errors, you're ready to go!
