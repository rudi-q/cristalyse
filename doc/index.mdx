## Quick Example

Here's how easy it is to create your first chart:

```dart
import 'package:cristalyse/cristalyse.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyChart extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final data = [
      {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'category': 'A'},
      {'x': 2, 'y': 3, 'category': 'B'},
      {'x': 3, 'y': 1, 'category': 'A'},
      {'x': 4, 'y': 4, 'category': 'C'},
    ];

    return CristalyseChart()
      .data(data)
      .mapping(x: 'x', y: 'y', color: 'category')
      .geomPoint(
        size: 8.0,
        alpha: 0.8,
        shape: PointShape.triangle,
        borderWidth: 1.5,
      )
      .scaleXContinuous()
      .scaleYContinuous()
      .theme(ChartTheme.defaultTheme())
      .build();
  }
}
```

**Result:** A beautiful, animated scatter plot that works identically on iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop.
